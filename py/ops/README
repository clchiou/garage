Collection of command-line ops scripts executed on the remote machines,
and are most commonly invoked by Ansible, doing heavy lifting for it.

You add more scripts to here only when both of the following are met:
* It is not possible to be done within a container.
* The alternative implementation in Ansible is clumsy.

Otherwise you should keep these ops scripts at minimum, meaning:
* If you are in situations where ops scripts need to be executed as a
  daemon, something probably went wrong.
* Ops scripts should only depend on Python 3 standard library (so that
  it is easy to deploy these scripts to the remote machine).
