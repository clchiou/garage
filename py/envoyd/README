# envoyd

This package implements a supervisor of envoy; it provides:
* Launch and monitor envoy process.
* Alter the envoy runtime configuration.

Although this package has a "d" suffix, it is quite a misnomer as it
does not implement a daemon in the traditional sense.  Instead, it
relies on container runtime and/or modern process monitoring tool, such
as supervisord or systemd, to help it properly "daemonize" itself.  This
package could instead be called "envoy supervisor", but that is too long
for a package name; so "envoyd" it is.

At the moment envoyd is not very flexible (although envoy is quite
versatile); envoyd only offers a pre-defined set of roles (currently
only one).  We limit ourselves because, to expose envoy's full feature
set to ops is probably counterproductive, and makes envoyd unnecessarily
complicated.

One of these roles is static frontend proxy (SFP).  The "static" name
means that the set of backend servers is static.
