error: implementation of `TryFrom` is not general enough

   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ implementation of `TryFrom` is not general enough
   |
   = note: `TryFrom<&'a [u8]>` would have to be implemented for the type `Struct<'a>`
   = note: ...but `TryFrom<&'0 [u8]>` is actually implemented for the type `Struct<'0>`, for some specific lifetime `'0`
