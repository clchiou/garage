Here is the shipyard, where you build executable containerized images of
your applications.

The build process itself is executed in a container as well, which we
usually refer to as a "builder", and naturally its image is referred to
as a "builder image".  To create a base builder image, you run:

  ./scripts/bootstrap TAG


The build process consists of two phases:

  * Build phase: In this phase, the build process builds and installs
    all intermediate and final artifacts _locally_ within the container.
    As a result, after the build phase is completed, the builder itself,
    if exported out as an image, is a full application image.  However,
    we generally don't create an application image this way because a
    builder has all the intermediate artifacts that takes much space.

  * Tapeout phase: In this phase, the build process creates the final
    application image.  As we said, we don't export a builder; instead,
    we cherry-pick only the build artifacts required in the application.
    The resulting application image is much smaller than its builder's.
