In addition to the CPython build file, here you may also find generic
Appc manifest and Dockerfile.

There are two hacks in the Appc manifest and Dockerfile:

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
  PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8

Not sure why I need them, but I've tried to import

  /etc/ld.so.conf
  /etc/default/locale

But this didn't work.
